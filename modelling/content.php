   <p>Euro Militaire is advertised as being the premiere scale
   modelling show in Europe, and a reason to visit the show.
   Indeed, a very nice collection of scale miiltary vehicle and
   figures was presented, from modellers far beyond the English
   Isles. It has to be said, quality of the models shown was
   outstanding. <a href="http://catch22.eu/modelling/euromilitaire2011/">Here</a> a
   photo set of some of the models, figures and diorama&#39;s that
   were taken on Saturday.</p><br />
