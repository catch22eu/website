<p>The set of programs used to compile and flash code to a microcontroller is named toolchain. As of writing, the standard GNU compiler toolchain can be used to compile source code into executable binaries. In order to obtain the toolchain it is cimply a matter of installing the correct package. On Debian, and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, Mint, Raspbian, etc, this can be done either via a package manager like Synaptic (which is a front-end for apt), or using apt directly on the command line:</p>
<code>sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi</code>
<p>Some background here: a special version of the gcc compiler is required for compiling code for a target processor other than the host computer. This is called cross-compiling. That explains the gcc-arm version of the compiler. The “none” version is needed to indicate the use without an operating system (also known as baremetal programming). If we were to compile a program used for an OS, some parts of the program can / should make use of the OS provided functions, for instance when allocating and referencing memory. Without an OS, these standard function need to be linked and added to the binary you are compiling. 
This will also install the other required packages like binutils and the c-library. </p>
