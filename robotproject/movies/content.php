        <p>Following videos of the hexapod robot are available for
        downloading:</p>

        <p><a href="walk.mpg"><img src="side.jpg" alt="" border="0"
        height="218" width="318" /><br />
        walk.mpg</a> (569kB, 6s). Shows Pivot (revision 2) walking from
        the side. As can be seen here, the legs still show some sliding
        due to the slippery underground. This can be minimized by using
        rubber feet, and fine tune the alignment of the legs.</p>

        <p><a href="walkturn.mpg"><img src="front.jpg" alt="" border=
        "0" height="218" width="316" /><br />
        walkturn.mpg</a> (1485kB, 16s). Shows Pivot (revision 2)
        walking towards the camera, make a 180 degree turn, and walk
        back. Right legs need to be raised a bit higher when compared
        to the left legs on the video.</p><br />
